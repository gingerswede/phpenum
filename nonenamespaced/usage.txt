This file have the intention of describing the usage of the none namespaced 
version of the enumeration extention.

First off you need to link in the purplekiwienum.php file. It is recommended
that this is done with the 'require_once' syntax. After this is done you can
extend your class that you want to transform into an enumeration with the
PurpleKiwiEnum class. This will add a few functions. For further information
about these functions, please consult the documentation file that should be
avaiable together with the purplekiwienum.php file.

Example:

<?php
require_once '/path/to/purplekiwienum.php';

class Enum
extends PurpleKiwiEnum{
	const January = 1;
	const February = 2;
	const March = 3;
	const April = 4;
	const May = 5;
	const June = 6;
	const July = 7;
	const August = 8;
	const September = 9;
	const October = 10;
	const November = 11;
	const December = 12;
}

After this is done, the class used as an enumeration can now be used similar
to an enumeration in other languages. Example:

Enum::GetKeys();

In this example an array sorted on the number value of the constants will be 
returned. Where the key in the array contain the number of the constants and
the values are a representative of the constant names.
